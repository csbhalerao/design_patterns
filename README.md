# Design patterns in ruby

This repo is for trying out various design patterns in ruby.

## How to test it?

# Observer Pattern

Run following command on terminal    
 - ruby observer_pattern/waiting_list_service.rb 5
 
 In above command waiting_list_service.rb is taking all inputs and generating observer and subject object.
 While 5 is number by which we are reducing waiting list.

 
# Decorator Pattern
 
 Run following command
 - ruby decorator_pattern/bill_calculator_service.rb gold gym lunch dinner
 
 In above command bill_calculator_service.rb is a class which is collecting all concrete entities and add-on services and combining them all to calculate the final cost of living on hotel.
 Here we chose Gold type room and we included the services gym, lunch and diner.
